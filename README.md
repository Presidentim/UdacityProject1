In this program, I used numpy, pandas, matplotlib, LinearRegression, train_test_spli,r2_score,and mean_squared_error.
I implement this project becuase of I'm studying a nanodegree in Udacity, it's a reqirement project about using the data they assigned to find out something cool.

This project contains four documents. The first is main.ipynb, which with all of the code inside.
The others are the data I download from Stack Overflow Survey, I downloaded the latest data, year 2020.

I used the code from Udacity's document for establish find_optimal_lm_mod function, it helps alot.
